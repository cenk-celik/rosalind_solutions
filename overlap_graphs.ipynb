    "A graph whose nodes have all been labeled can be represented by an adjacency list, in which each row of the list contains the two node labels corresponding to a unique edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "A directed graph (or digraph) is a graph containing directed edges, each of which has an orientation. That is, a directed edge is represented by an arrow instead of a line segment; the starting and ending nodes of an edge form its tail and head, respectively. The directed edge with tail **v** and head **w** is represented by **(v,w)** (but not by **(w,v)**). A directed loop is a directed edge of the form **(v,v)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a collection of strings and a positive integer **k**, the overlap graph for the strings is a directed graph O_k in which each string is represented by a node, and string **s** is connected to string **t** with a directed edge when there is a length **k** suffix of **s** that matches a length **k** prefix of **t**, as long as **s ≠ t**; we demand **s ≠ t** to prevent directed loops in the overlap graph (although directed cycles may be present).\n",

    "> **Given:** A collection of DNA strings in FASTA format having total length at most 10 kbp.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Return:** The adjacency list corresponding to O_3. You may return edges in any order."
