# Rosalind Bioinformatics Problems

## Hi!

I am a newbie in programming with a long biology background.
Here, I share the solutions for problems in [ROSALIND](https://rosalind.info) website.
The solutions might not be optimum for coding.
All I want to do is learning to write scripts from the scratch, with **minimum library use**.

Feel [**free to comment or make suggestions**](https://cenkcelik.info).
