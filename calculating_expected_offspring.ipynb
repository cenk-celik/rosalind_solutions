    "For a random variable **X** taking integer values between 1 and **n**, the expected value of **X** is **E(X) = ∑n_k = 1_k × Pr(X = k)**. The expected value offers us a way of taking the long-term average of a random variable over a large number of trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a motivating example, let **X** be the number on a six-sided die. Over a large number of rolls, we should expect to obtain an average of 3.5 on the die (even though it's not possible to roll a 3.5). The formula for expected value confirms that **E(X) = ∑6_k = 1_k × Pr(X = k) = 3.5**.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, a random variable for which every one of a number of equally spaced outcomes has the same probability is called a uniform random variable (in the die example, this \"equal spacing\" is equal to 1). We can generalize our die example to find that if **X** is a uniform random variable with minimum possible value a and maximum possible value **b**, then **E(X) = (a + b)/2**. You may also wish to verify that for the dice example, if **Y** is the random variable associated with the outcome of a second die roll, then **E(X + Y) = 7**.\n",

In order, the six given integers represent the number of couples having the following genotypes:\n",
