# # Finding a Protein Motif
# ##Â Problem
# 
# To allow for the presence of its varying forms, a protein motif is represented by a shorthand as follows: \[XY\] means "either **X** or **Y**" and **{X}** means "any amino acid except **X**." For example, the N-glycosylation motif is written as **N{P}\[ST\]{P}**.
# 
# You can see the complete description and features of a particular protein by its access ID "uniprot_id" in the UniProt database, by inserting the ID number into [here](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/uniprot_id)
# 
# Alternatively, you can obtain a protein sequence in FASTA format [here](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/uniprot_id.fasta)
# 
# For example, the data for protein **B5ZC00** can be found at  [here](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/B5ZC00).
# 
# > **Given:** At most 15 UniProt Protein Database access IDs.
# 
# > **Return:** For each protein possessing the N-glycosylation motif, output its given access ID followed by a list of locations in the protein string where the motif can be found.
